# FIT3140 — Advanced Programming

#### Summary Notes by [By Carlos Melegrito](http://mlgrto.com)

This is everything I've noted down for my Advanced Programming unit during the entire semester. Not only will it serve as my revision notes for my exam, but also for reference in the future. Note that a lot of this content stems from [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu), but these writings are of my own.
