# UI (Mobile Devices)

### UI vs UX

- According my Uni, **UI Design** refers to "_a series of screens, pages and visual elements_"
- And **UX Design** refers to "_the internal experience that a person has as they interact with every aspect of a company's products and services_"
- This is not the case. In the real world, designers are responsible the experience a person has with a product, which includes building interfaces (i.e. there shouldn't be a distinction; it's a continuum)

## Building UI for Native Apps

- Android Studio
- Xamarin
- Kivy

## Native vs. Cross-Platform vs. Hybrid

### Native Apps

#### Pros

- Provides access to all the features provided by the device and OS
- No limitations in terms of app performance and speed besides device's raw capability
- Built using tech recommended and used by the device's manufacturer
- Can provide a native UI out of the box
- No limitations in UI design

#### Cons

- Supporting multiple devices requires separate development
- Little to no code can be shared between different apps
- Development time can be slow

### Cross-Platform Apps

#### Pros

- Code can be shared between different versions of the apps (but not all)
- UI is rendered using native controls, so UI can be as fast as native

#### Cons

- Not all code can be shared, some native code may need to be written
- Speed may be impacted as language needs to be interpreted/adapted on the fly
- Access to device and operating system rely on framework or plugin support
- UI building is dependent on framework support


### HTML5 Hybrid Apps

#### Pros

- Code can be shared between different versions of the apps (but not all)
- Building the core part of the app using web tech enables faster development
- Many open-source or popular vendor-specific libraries
- The core of an app can be updated without going via an App Store

#### Cons

- Not all code can be shared, some native code may need to be written
- Speed can be hugely impacted, as interaction is running via a web-browser
- Access to device and operating system features are dependent on the framework or plugin support
