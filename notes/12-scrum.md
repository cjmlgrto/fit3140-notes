# Scrum

> Scrum is an interative, incremental framework for projects and product or application development

— The Scrum Primer

## The Team

- Contains 7±2 people
- Contains all the skills needed to build the product
- _Self-managing_
- 100% dedicated to the team's task
- Stable
- Working in proximity

### The Scrum Master

- Not the manager of the team
- Guides the team in the use of Scrum
- Protects team from outside interference
- Removes obstacles identified by Team and Product Owner

### The Product Owner

- May be one customer, representative of customers or internal staff member
- Tells team what to build
- Responsible for maintaining a **Product Backlog** — a prioritized list of tasks for the team
- Decides with _guidance_ from the team
- Responsible for the team
- Goal os to maximise "business value" (Return on Investment)

## Business Value (Return on Investment)

Given options for building a product:

1. Survey the options and calculate their costs, timelines and profits
2. Take into account partial solutions and the "time value of money" — this is called the **Net Present Value**
3. Compare values and lay out the options for all stakeholders

## Sprints

- Fixed-length iterations
- Usually 1-4 weeks long
- You keep doing sprints until the project is "done"

### Sprint Planning

Composed of a two-phase process that usually takes one day's (8 hours) work:

#### Phase 1:

- Product Owner reviews/explains highest-priority items in backlog (entire team involved)


#### Phase 2:

- Team (with help from Scrum Master) decomposes backlog items into smaller tasks with estimates of time (Sprint Backlog)
- Figures out how much they can commit to
- Product Owner must be available, but not necessarily present for this

### Doing the Sprint

- Team self-organises tasks in Sprint backlog
- Progress recorded on a **Burndown Chart** — a graph of days against remaining Story points
- As task is completed, line on burn-down chart goes down
- Product Owner cannot ask for additional things during the sprint

### Daily Scrum

- 15-minute meeting at the start of each day
- Each team member answers 3 questions:
	- What they did yesterday
	- What they plan to do today
	- What is preventing them from accomplishing these tasks
- Not a discussion session
	- Scrum Master works with Team as necessary after meeting to resolve issues

### Backlog Maintenance

- 5% of sprint time should be devoted to updating Product Backlog (1 day in a 4-week sprint cycle)
- About refining material for next couple of sprints
- Product Owner and Team should collaborate on this

### Sprint Ends

- The product may be "shippable" at this point
- Features / Stories can either be "done" or "not done" (never "half-done")
- Iterations are of fixed length
- Team may have overcommitted (i.e. not everything got done) — these will be placed in the next sprint or depending on the Product Owner's direction
- Team may have undercommitted (here, ask Product Owner what to do next)
- Aim to estimate more accurately for the next sprint

### Sprint Review

- Review the state of the _product_
- Usually includes demo, but it's not just about the demo, it's about the conversation between the Product Owner and the Team
- The demo should not require elaborate preparation
- Other stakeholders encouraged to attend

### Sprint Retrospective

- Review the _process_ by which the product is being built
- Product Owner may or may not attend
- External facilitator may be useful (Scrum Master from another team?)
- Two key questions:
	- What is working well?
	- What could be done better?
